### Challenge
How to use technology for connecting individuals and families who have beaten cancer with others who are still fighting against it for exchange of experiences and advice.

## Solution
We have created an intelligent matchmaking algorithm that analyzes raw data from different sources and creates matches based on absolute data (such as age, gender, type of cancer, type of treatment and location) as well as relative data from social graphs like personal preferences, interests, hobbies, behaviors, places they have visited, events they have attended, campaigns they have supported.

## Objective
To apply that intelligence to the real world, we created a mobile application. Instead of creating a boring, long profile, we focused on keeping the mood fresh by giving personality to the app, kind of like a conversation. As our users go through the flow, they give us the data we need to create accurate matches. And if they don’t feel comfortable sharing something, like their location or even their social connections, they don’t have to. Our algorithm can work with as little as one or two pieces of data. The more we get, the more accurate our matching will be.

##Technical requirements to run the application
* Nodejs
* Npm
* Git
 
## Skills requirements
* ionic-angular
* html5
* css
* javascript
* git

## Conclusion
By creating better, more compatible matches, we expect patients to have an easier time dealing with their Cancer and by the time they reach the end of their treatments, look back at their experience and maybe start the program again, this time helping someone else go through the same issues they had just overcome.

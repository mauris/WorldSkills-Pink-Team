2. Heavy, isn’t it? I imagine if any of us here today heard that from a doctor, we wouldn’t quite know how to deal with it. Shock. Numbness.

3. But eventually being alone, in front of the mirror, would lead us to have to face and accept reality. Not to our parents, not to our kids, not to our bosses and co-workers, but to ourselves.

4. “I felt like I had just been robbed of all my plans, my hopes and dreams.” (quote from close family member, diagnosed with cancer twice in the last 5 years). She fought it. She won. Twice.

5. Cancer is as much of an emotional issue as it is a physical issue. Wether choosing traditional or alternative treatment, having a solid emotional foundation and support throughout this period can wield amazing results in combination with regular treatment plans.

6. None of us can claim to even begin to understand what a Cancer patient goes through. Saying “I know what you’re going through.” doesn’t cut it. So we want to help Cancer patients connect to former Cancer patients and people that have had a relationship with Cancer somehow, through a close family member or a friend for example.

7. To achieve that, we have created an intelligent matchmaking algorithm that analyzes raw data from different sources and creates matches based on absolute data (such as age, gender, type of cancer, type of treatment and location) as well as relative data from social graphs like personal preferences, interests, hobbies, behaviors, places they have visited, events they have attended, campaigns they have supported.

8. To apply that intelligence to the real world, we created a mobile application. Instead of creating a boring, long profile, we focused on keeping the mood fresh by giving personality to the app, kind of like a conversation. As our users go through the flow, they give us the data we need to create accurate matches. And if they don’t feel comfortable sharing something, like their location or even their social connections, they don’t have to. Our algorithm can work with as little as one or two pieces of data. The more we get, the more accurate our matching will be.

9. By creating better, more compatible matches, we expect patients to have an easier time dealing with their Cancer and by the time they reach the end of their treatments, look back at their experience and maybe start the program again, this time helping someone else go through the same issues they had just overcome.

10. According to the National Cancer Institute of Brazil (INCA), there will be almost 600 thousand new cases of Cancer in 2015 in Brazil alone, an increase of 11% in comparison to 2012. Our solution is robust, flexible and, once deployed, works with near-zero human interaction so it can easily handle that demand and keep high performance and accuracy rates. It can also be expanded and applied to other conditions such as disabilities, alcoholism and drug abuse.

11. Pairing cancer patients with former cancer patients to provide emotional support and increase treatment efficiency has been validated by Portal SuperAção, our partner ONG. They have about 65 people in their program right now, with a total of 110 helped since its foundation in 2013. Considering up until this point all their has been done manually, on Google Docs, by one person, we feel our solution will empower them and other organizations to do less admin work and focus on what really matters: helping more people.
